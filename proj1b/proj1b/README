Included files:

lab1b-client.c:
- a program that implements a telnet-like client
- this is achieved by using character-at-a-time/full duplex terminal I/O, polled I/O, and communicating with the server over a socket 
- supports the following optional command line options:
  --port=port ... use the specified port to open a socket connection to the server (argument port required)
  --log=filename ... use the specified filename to log all data written to or read from the server to that file (argument filename required)
  --compress ... compress communication to and decompress communication from the server using zlib
- summary of exit codes:
  0 ... normal execution, shutdown on ^D
  1 ... unrecognized argument or system call failure

lab1b-server.c:
- a multi-process program that implements a telnet-like server
- this is achieved by using polled I/O, passing I/O between the client and server over a socket, and passing I/O between the server and a shell over pipes
- supports the following optional command line options:
  --port=port ... use the specified port to open a socket connection to the client (argument port required)
  --compress ... compress communication to and decompress communication from the client using zlib
- summary of exit codes:
  0 ... normal execution, shutdown on ^D
  1 ... unrecognized argument or system call failure

Makefile:
- supports the following targets:
  build (default) ... build both the lab1b-client and lab1b-server executables with the -g, -Wall, -Wextra, and -lz options
  lab1b-client ... build the lab1b-client executable with the -g, -Wall, -Wextra, and -lz options
  lab1b-server ... build the lab1b-server executable with the -g, -Wall, -Wextra, and -lz options
  clean ...  delete all files created by the Makefile
  dist ... build the distribution tarball
