#
# purpose:
#	 generate data reduction graphs for the multi-threaded list project
#
# input: lab2b_list.csv
#	1. test name
#	2. # threads
#	3. # iterations per thread
#	4. # lists
#	5. # operations performed (threads x iterations x (ins + lookup + delete))
#	6. run time (ns)
#	7. run time per operation (ns)
#
# output:
#	lab2b_1.png ... throughput vs. number of threads for mutex and spin-lock synchronized list operations
#	lab2b_2.png ... mean time per mutex wait and mean time per operation for mutex-synchronized list operations
#	lab2b_3.png ... successful iterations vs. threads for each synchronization method
#	lab2b_4.png ... throughput vs. number of threads for mutex synchronized partitioned lists
#	lab2b_5.png ... throughput vs. number of threads for spin-lock-synchronized partitioned lists
#
# Note:
#	Managing data is simplified by keeping all of the results in a single
#	file.  But this means that the individual graphing commands have to
#	grep to select only the data they want.
#
#	Early in your implementation, you will not have data for all of the
#	tests, and the later sections may generate errors for missing data.
