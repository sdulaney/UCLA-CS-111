lab4b.c:
- an embedded application reads data from a temperature sensor and button, logs the results, and supports commands from STDIN
- usage: ./lab4b [OPTION]...
- valid options: --period=# (default 1), --scale=[FC] (default F), --log=filename
- valid commans from STDIN:
  SCALE=F
	This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Fahrenheit.
  SCALE=C
	This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Centegrade
  PERIOD=seconds
	This command should change the number of seconds between reporting intervals.
  STOP
	This command should cause the program to stop generating reports, but continue processing input commands.
  START
	This command should cause the program to, if stopped, resume generating reports.
  LOG line of text
      This command performs no action beyond logging its receipt.
  OFF
	This command should, like pressing the button, output (and log) a time-stamped SHUTDOWN message and exit.

Makefile:
- supports the following targets:
  build (default) ... build the lab4b executable
  lab4b ... build the lab4b executable
  check ... execute an automated smoke-test of the application by running test.sh
  clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
  dist ... create the deliverable tarball

test.sh:
- shell script containing automated smoke-test of the application
