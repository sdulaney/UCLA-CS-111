QUESTION 2.1.1 - causing conflicts:
- Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?
- Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?
The answer to both questions is the same: for a small enough number of iterations a thread is likely to finish its' processing of the shared data before the next thread is created and the thread scheduler has a chance to context switch to the next thread. As a result, the likelihood of a race condition is lower and the likelihood of all iterations for a single thread being an atomic operation is higher.
