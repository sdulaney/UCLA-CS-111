Included files:

lab4c.c:
- extension of lab4b.c
- single program that implements both Part 1 (integration with logging server using TCP) and Part 2 (integration with logging server using TLS/SSL)
- chooses to use Part 1 or Part 2 based on the name by which it was invoked (lab4c_tcp or lab4c_tls, respectively)
- usage: ./lab4c_tcp [OPTION]... port # (mandatory)
- valid options: --period=# (default 1), --scale=[FC] (default F), --log=filename (mandatory), --id=9-digit-number (mandatory), --host=name or address (mandatory)
- usage: ./lab4c_tls [OPTION]... port # (mandatory)
- valid options: --period=# (default 1), --scale=[FC] (default F), --log=filename (mandatory), --id=9-digit-number (mandatory), --host=name or address (mandatory)
- an embedded application reads data from a temperature sensor, logs the results to a file and a logging server, and supports commands from the logging server
- valid commands:
  SCALE=F
	  This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Fahrenheit.
  SCALE=C
	  This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Centegrade.
  PERIOD=seconds
	  This command should change the number of seconds between reporting intervals.
  STOP
	  This command should cause the program to stop generating reports, but continue processing input commands.
  START
	  This command should cause the program to, if stopped, resume generating reports.
  LOG line of text
    This command performs no action beyond logging its receipt.
  OFF
	  This command should output (and log) a time-stamped SHUTDOWN message and exit.

Makefile:
- supports the following targets:
  build (default) ... build the lab4c executable and create hard links to lab4c_tcp and  lab4c_tls
  lab4c ... build the lab4c executable and create hard links to lab4c_tcp and  lab4c_tls
  clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
  dist ... create the deliverable tarball
