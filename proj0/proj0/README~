Included files:

lab0.c:
- a program that copies its standard input to its standard output
- supports the following optional command line options:
  --input=filename ... use the specified file as standard input (argument filename required)
  --output=filename ... create the specified file and use it as standard output (argument filename required)
  --segfault ... force a segmentation fault
  --catch catch the segmentation fault and log an error message
- summary of exit codes:
  0 ... copy successful
  1 ... unrecognized argument
  2 ... unable to open input file
  3 ... unable to open output file
  4 ... caught and received SIGSEGV

Makefile:
- supports the following targets:
  build (default) ... build the lab0 executable with the -g, -Wall, and -Wextra options
  check ... runs a quick smoke-test on whether or not the program seems to work, supports the required arguments, and properly reports success or failure
  clean ...  delete all files created by the Makefile
  dist ... build the distribution tarball

backtrace.png:
- screenshot of running program with the --segfault option under gdb and getting a stack backtrace

breakpoint.png:
- screenshot of running program with the --segfault option under gdb after setting a breakpoint at the assignment that causes the segmentation fault, and inspecting the pointer to confirm that it is NULL

Smoke-test cases (check target of Makefile):
- correctly copy input to output
- correctly implements --input
- correctly implements --output
- implements combined --input + --output
- correct handling of un-openable/un-creatable output file
- correct handling of non-existent/un-openable input file
- correct handling of invalid arguments
- generate (and die from) SIGSEGV
- catch and report SIGSEGV
